# Brute Force Attack Detection Report

## 1. Introduction
Brute-force attacks are a common cybersecurity threat where attackers repeatedly attempt to guess login credentials. This report details the implementation of a Python-based brute-force detection system that monitors authentication logs in real time.

## 2. Problem Statement
Unauthorized access attempts often involve multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address. Traditional security systems may not always detect such attempts unless specific monitoring is implemented.

## 3. Objectives
- Identify repeated failed login attempts within a specified time window.
- Flag suspicious IPs exceeding a predefined threshold.
- Provide real-time alerts to enhance security response.

## 4. Methodology
### 4.1 Log File Analysis
The script reads from an authentication log file (e.g., `auth.log`), parsing each line to extract:
- Failed login attempts
- Associated IP addresses
- Timestamps of occurrences

### 4.2 Threshold-Based Detection
The script maintains a dictionary of failed attempts per IP address and applies the following logic:
- If an IP exceeds `THRESHOLD_ATTEMPTS` (e.g., 5 attempts) within `TIME_WINDOW` seconds (e.g., 60 seconds), it is flagged.
- Older failed attempts outside the time window are discarded to keep the detection relevant.

### 4.3 Real-Time Monitoring
By continuously reading the log file, the script provides near real-time detection without requiring extensive computation.

## 5. Findings
Using simulated authentication logs, the script successfully detected brute-force attempts:
- IP **192.168.1.10** attempted **5 failed logins** within **45 seconds**.
- The system flagged this IP as a potential brute-force attacker and outputted an alert.

## 6. Mitigation Strategies
To enhance security further:
- Implement automatic IP blocking using firewall rules (e.g., `iptables` or `fail2ban`).
- Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regularly audit authentication logs for anomalies.

## 7. Conclusion
The brute-force detection script effectively identifies and alerts on unauthorized access attempts. Future improvements may include integration with SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems and automatic response mechanisms.
